Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

Start with git commands:
clone > aBring a repository that is hosted somewhere like github
into your machine.

add > Track your files and changes in git

commit > Save your files in git

push > upload git commits to a remote repo, like Github

pull > Download changes from remote repo to your local machine,
        opposite of push


So lets make a repo and get it into git.
Start by making a repo and use the Clone SSH value under Code
use git clone to bring that into your git folder, looks like this

git clone https://gitforwindows.org/


** we had to git init the parent folder for this to work
** Also uninstall / re-install with this advice
** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55355147/fatal-protocol-https-is-not-supported
** git remote add origin https://github.com/moscato/demo-repo.git
** not sure if this step was necessary though

But now we have the folder in VS code.

SO if we run git status, we can see untracked files.
we need to track them so git knows about them.

git add . would work for the entire directory (staged)

Now that the changes are staged, we can commit

git commit -m "~~~" doesnt work
bash: $'\302\203git': command not found

git commit and then notes in github then close does... apparently

This is only local though, now we git push
Except not really, cause we need to set up the SSH key.

we do this with git command
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@example.com"

where 
-t == type of encryption
-b == strength of encryption
-C == email associated with your github

We named the key testkey and set no password, so we can now find it using 
ls | grep testkey
(I assume it exists in this directory)

we return testkey & testkey.pub
testkey.pub is what we will upload to github


cat testkey.pub > copy this and paste into profile > 
settings > shh and GPH keys > new key > paste it.

git push origin master ... works.


SOOOOOOO the workflow for pushing to repo goes:

git add .
git commit . -m "Whatever comment"
git push origin main
